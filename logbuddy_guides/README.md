# LogBuddy Guides

This folder contains a few guides based on real appeals. LogBuddy can be started with opening SS13 tools and selection option 1. If you used pip, you can open it with `ss13tools` or even `logbuddy` in your terminal.

To see a full list of all available commands, please see [this guide](../ss13_tools/log_buddy/README.md#available-commands-cheat-sheet), for a quick start see [quick start](../ss13_tools/log_buddy/README.md#quick-start)
